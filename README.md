# React Weather App

A simple React application that allows users to explore the weather forecast for different cities. The app uses React Router for navigation, along with hooks like `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useParams` to manage the state, fetch data, and create interactive functionality.

## Features

- **City List**: Displays a list of cities (New York, London, Tokyo) with links to their respective weather forecasts.
- **Weather Forecast**: Displays a summary of the weather and detailed weather information upon clicking "View Details."
- **Scrolling Feature**: A button to scroll smoothly to the detailed weather section.
- **City Images**: Relevant images for each city are displayed along with the weather data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing and navigating between pages.

- **CSS**: To style the components and create a modern, responsive design.
